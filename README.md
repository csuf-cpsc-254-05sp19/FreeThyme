# FreeThyme
Our project involves using the google calendar API to generate a time and date when a given number of calendars have an opening. The application utilizes Python, Flask, and bootstrap; Python and Flask would be used to create the backend while Bootstrap would be used for the frontend. The goal of our application is to simplify the task of scheduling events for everyone involved.
