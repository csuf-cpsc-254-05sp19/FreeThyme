> Additional information or tag line

Our project involves using the google calendar API to generate a time and date when a given number of calendars have an opening. Python and Flask would be used to create the backend while Bootstrap would be used for the frontend. The goal of our application is to simplify the task of scheduling events for everyone involved.

## Developing

### Built With
 Python, Flask, and Bootstrap


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.
